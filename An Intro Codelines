ls = list show | -l = in list way | -a = show hidden files in the shell | -h = print size with parameters | -s = size
[work with a list, similar in python and there is a commands to work as a strings]
ls - l [abcdef] OR ls - l [a-f] = make a list of all files start with 'a' to 'f' exist
ls abc[defghi] OR ls abc[d-i] = make a list of all files have the letters d to i after 'abc', so the files are abcd , abce , abcf , abcg , abch , abci PAY ATENTION DONT WORKS FOR NUMBERS just 1-9
ls abc? = wild-card character to represent exactly one of any kind of character after 'abc'
ls abc{d,e,f,g,h,i} or ls abc{d..i} = PAY ATENTION ON DOTS BETWEEN 'd' AND 'i' MEANS YOU WANNA GET A RANGE LIKE IN [ ] and the resutl is te same as "ls abc[d-i]"
ls abc{$((10*5)),$[2**5]} = show list (literaly) of "abc50" and "abc32"
ls /abc/d*f = takes all files in 'abc' directory start to 'd' and finish with 'f' (litteraly) doesn't matter the length name, therefore the * menas 
ls /abc/defg[h-o]* = shows all files in 'abc' directory with name 'defg' follow with letter 'h' to 'o' and doesn't matter the  length name | SAME OF ls /abc/defg{h..o}*
ls /abc/defg[hijl]* = shows all files in 'abc' directory with name 'defg' follow with letter 'h' to 'l' and doesn't matter the legnt name
ls /abc/defg[hijl]? = shows all files in 'abc' directory with name 'defg' follow with letter 'h' to 'l' and have just one more letter after the string variate, therefore just a file with 6 letters
