### CONDA



### Download in https://trimal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
### enter in github and take the link of source or the executable
(base) $ wget https://github.com/inab/trimal/archive/refs/tags/v1.5.0.tar.gz ; tar -xf * ; cd trimal*/ ; ls
###### OR #######
(base) $ wget https://github.com/inab/trimal/releases/download/v1.5.0/trimAl_Linux_x86-64.zip ; gunzip * ; cd 

### follow the instructions.
(base) ~/trimAl/trimal-1.5.0$ cd source ; make ; ls
### now use the command, start using -h and choce the best options.
(base) ~/trimAl/trimal-1.5.0/source$ cd ../ ; source/trimal -h

### <command> -in <input> -out <output> -htmlout <outputHTML> -mega <outputmega> -splitbystopcodon
(base) ~/trimAl/trimal-1.5.0$ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out trimmed_*.fasta -mega -keepheader -noallgaps -sgc
### splitbystopcodon can be only set up together backtranslation functionality (-backtrans <aminoacid_inputfile>)

### Examples
### Removes all positions in the alignment with gaps in 5% or more of the sequences, unless this leaves less than 80% of original alignment
### print the 80% best (with less gaps) positions.
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -cons 80 -gt 0.05 -keepheader -sgc
### Use an automatic method to decide optimal thresholds, based in the gap scores from input alignment
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -gappyout
### Use an heuristic to decide the optimal method for trimming the alignment
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -automated1

### Use residues and sequences overlap thresholds to delete some sequences from the alignment.
### Both overlap thresholds (-resoverlap and -seqoverlap) must be provided jointly.
### Remove the sequencies possess 80% of positions which have 90% of overlaping (having a gap in both positions)
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -resoverlap 0.9 -seqoverlap 80 -noallgaps

### Selection of columns to be deleted from the alignment. The selection can be a column number or a column number interval. Start from 0
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -selectcols { 0,2,3,10,45-60,68,70-78 }
### Selection of sequences to be deleted from the alignment. Start from 0
(base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -selectseqs { 2,4,8-12 }

# (base) $ source/trimal -in *.fasta -out -trimmed_*.fasta -cons 80 -st 0.8 -keepheader -noallgaps -sgc
