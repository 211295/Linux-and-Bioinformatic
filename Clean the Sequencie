### Start download the Univec and
$ wget 
$ apt-get install zlib1g-dev

### I start the command-c = Turns on contaminants screening, default=off, <filename> - is a path to a FASTA-file containing contaminant genomes.
### Using the argument -U <filename> = Single-end mode
### -o to send the new archive to
$ /home/usuary_name/directory_name/seqyclean-1.10.09/bin/seqyclean -U archive_name -c /home/usuary_name//directory_name/UniVec -minlen 50 -qual 24 24 -o /home/usuary_name/directory_name/folder_name

### I change to command -v = Turns on vector trimming, default=off. <filename> - is a path to a FASTA-file containing vector genomes.
