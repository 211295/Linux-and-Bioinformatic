### Start download the Univec and
$ wget 
apt-get install zlib1g-dev

### I start the command-c - Turns on contaminants screening, default=off, <filename> - is a path to a FASTA-file containing contaminant genomes.
### I change to command -v - Turns on vector trimming, default=off. <filename> - is a path to a FASTA-file containing vector genomes.
